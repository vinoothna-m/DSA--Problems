# 🧑‍💻 DSA in Python

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** solutions in Python.  

Each solution includes:

✅ Problem statement & examples

✅ Step-by-step explanation

✅ Python implementation

✅ Time & Space complexity analysis 

📌 Goal: Solve 100+ DSA problems across across all major topics while following clean coding practices.

🔹 Topics Covered

-Arrays & Searching

-Strings & Pattern Matching

-Linked Lists (Singly/Doubly)

-Stacks & Queues

-Recursion & Backtracking

-Trees (Binary Tree, BST)

-Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths, MST)

-Dynamic Programming

This repo serves as a reference guide for interview prep and a portfolio project to showcase problem-solving skills.
